                                    a treatment of retinal disease. Such disease affects 500 million
                                    people worldwide and it isn’t great. We’re trying to change it
                                    by developing a medical device that performs image-guided laser
                                    surgery driven and enabled by ML. Thus, Machine Learning plays a
                                    big aspect of everything that we’re doing in terms of
                                    diagnostics, creation, or treatment planning, and then the
                                    treatment itself.</span

                                    So, our relationship with ISAIC is primarily related to AIPP.
                                    The program involves training folks in all stages of life to AI
                                    and ML. I’m really happy to be a part of something collaborative
                                    like that to build educational content for people. Primarily in

                                    student projects and student-led research.</span

                                    >For example, our first project was identifying something called
                                    micro aneurysms on retina images, which is a disease called
                                    Diabetic Retinopathy. It will cause debilitating degradation of
                                    vision. Our goal for this project was to look at these images
                                    and detect where in the images we should target for the
                                    treatment with our laser system. Another way to do this is to
                                    hire an opthamologist and spend thousands of hours annotating
                                    images. But we can’t really do that because we’re an early-stage
                                    startup. Instead, we used semi-supervised learning or
                                    unsupervised learning to build these models so we can detect
                                    areas of the disease and build treatment plans without the need
                                    of expert annotation. </span

                                    through your eyes as you’re looking into a bright light. The key
                                    interest for us is to find ways to accurately track these in 2D
                                    and eventually, 3D so we can target them for treatment. We have

                                    The AI Pathways Partnership programs are actually new to
                                    Concordia so really, it has been exciting to be able to come in
                                    and hit the ground running and deal with a relatively large
                                    cohort of students and to be able to meet their needs.The
                                    support we receive from ISAIC is really quick and were easily
                                    implemented. We have nothing to worry ourselves about the
                                    technical details and when it came to building and implementing,
                                    ISAIC came to help the large cohort of students.</span

                                    In terms of problem solving, Cybera does quite a range of things
                                    from data wrangling to the development of ML proof of concept
                                    and prototype projects, working with small data sets, as well as
                                    big data sets. We really are trying to apply the
                                    state-of-the-art technologies and tools to these problems to
                                    solve whatever business problems people are facing.We do our
                                    best to engage clients and help them throughout their journey
                                    because oftentimes, this was our clients’ first foray into data

                                    Pulse Medica is founded in mid 2020 and we have been operating
                                    for about 2 years as a company. We had two successful
                                    fundraising rounds. We’ve built a world class team of engineers
                                    - we’re about 22 individuals in the company and we essentially
                                    have two prototypes that we’re going to put into clinics here in
                                    Edmonton. We’re just in the process of getting approvals from
                                    Health Canada. So, it’s very exciting so far and a lot of
                                    success in terms of ML.</span

                                    we really need something that has a lot more purpose built in
                                    and a much more tailored fit for what we’re doing in the ML
                                    program. That’s how we turned to ISAIC. We needed a partner that
                                    understood our needs as an educational institution and who was
                                    able to sit down with us to understand what we were trying to
                                    accomplish and how we’re going to do that to make sure that
                                    we’re building a solution that fits the needs of our students,
                                    rather than just taking something off-the-shelf (that is
                                    static). Folks at ISAIC really helped us making sure that we get
                                    exactly the right build for our use case.</span

                                    Cybera has a pretty long experience with cloud computing - I
                                    think for about 12 years now. We were the first in establishing
                                    an open stack production environment in the world and in
                                    Alberta. So, we have quite a bit of experience running our own
                                    Rapid Access Cloud environment. Internally, we encourage our
                                    data science team (data scientists and developers) to use cloud
                                    computing infrastructure and resources to manage their data.
                                    Cloud computing is great and you should use cloud computing. We
                                    also try to leverage cloud computing in our projects, including
                                    the data science projects.</span

                                    Regarding data, we have access to one of the largest image
                                    databases in the world. We deal with tons and tons of data. In
                                    terms of cloud infrastructure, it was really difficult to
                                    predict what kind of resources we needed particularly when it
                                    comes to the kind of GPUs and memory we need, as well as storing
                                    the data, which can be expensive. Being able to explore without
                                    a huge capital investment on our part, as well as being able to
                                    scale the resources (adding GPUs, etc.) was very
                                    important. </span

                                    Sure. So, based on our experience setting up our own cloud
                                    infrastructure service, Rapid Access Cloud, we helped advise
                                    ISAIC right from the get go. For example, we discussed the
                                    options they might have in terms of setting up their
                                    infrastructure and we provided advice and lessons learned in
                                    terms of what worked for Cybera and what didn’t work well for
                                    us. I think ISAIC definitely took the information and turned it
                                    to services with really nice products and really nice services
                                    that are user-friendly.</span

                                    It is kind of an interesting conversation because what happened
                                    was that Pulse Medica was just started and we had this shared
                                    space to sit at the University of Alberta (we were a spin-off
                                    company from the university). In that shared space, we got to
                                    know about ISAIC and we asked them what they were doing. They
                                    mentioned infrastructure and long story short, we built a
                                    relationship and we have been working together for about two
                                    years now. </span
