                        cloud.

                      <p>
                        <strong>Concordia:</strong> ​​For us, primarily that takes the form of
                        Jupyter installations. Our students are often using Jupyter Notebooks which
                        are sort of interactive Python Notebooks that they can access through their
                        browser. In our case, those are backed by GPU-enabled instances which are
                        very important for machine learning and AI. That’s really allowed our
                        students to build experiments and build models that really reiterate on the
                        projects that they’re working on in a rapid turnaround fashion. We also use
                        a few virtual machines in that traditional sense but for our students, it’s
                        primarily through having that purpose built JupyterHub installation. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <strong>Cybera:</strong> We’ve collaborated with ISAIC on the
                        <a href="https://www.cybera.ca/fellowships/">fellowship program</a> but also
                        on different consultations and events such as Hackathons. Typically, we’ve
                        been using the <a href="https://vmod.isaic.ca/">VM on Demand</a> service and
                        in the case of the fellowship program, each of our aspiring or emerging data
                        scientists get assigned a VM on Demand and they can use that VM for their
                        entire project. These projects are connected to businesses, business ideas
                        and business problems and these businesses can decide to continue on using
                        the ISAIC services. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Our client base will come to us with data science problems but once we’ve
                        wrapped up on our side of things, they’re looking for support on the
                        infrastructure side so we connect with ISAIC to further their development
                        and their use of cloud infrastructure.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <strong>Pulse Medica:</strong> We have a virtual machine at ISAIC that gets
                        used almost 24/7. When we started, it was just one team member for a single
                        project but now we distribute those resources across multiple people for
                        multiple projects so, it’s a lot of usage. 
                      </p>

                        <strong>Concordia:</strong> The devil’s in the details, as they say. There’s
                        a lot involved to make sure we’re right-sizing our equipment, that we’re
                        building a service that’s going to be sufficient for students in all of the
                        different ways they need to operate, and we need to be able to scale it when
                        we have changs in student enrollment. That always means growth and the
                        ability for us to rapidly turn that around by dealing with a group that has
                        a lot of expertise in operating this infrastructure has been really
                        invaluable.

                        <strong>Cybera:</strong> Some of the biggest things around cloud
                        infrastructure is you can leverage it to do things you just can’t do on your
                        own laptop, for example. The power of cloud computing is pretty profound,
                        you can scale up your efforts really easily. With the cost of cloud
                        computing going down, with access to cloud computing increasing, there’s no
                        reason to limit yourself to what you have. You can easily go out there and
                        find cloud service providers like ISAIC, so the barrier to adoption has
                        significantly dropped. ISAIC’s hands-on concierge type service makes it easy
                        and less intimidating to take that first step and really engage. The user
                        interface has made infrastructure as a service less intimidating as well.
                        Through ISAIC’s approach, they’ve really reduced the barrier to usage and
                        adoption.

                        <strong>Pulse Medica:</strong> A key concern is the ability to explore the
                        scale of resources we need without having to invest in hardware ourselves,
                        and that’s what ISAIC allowed us to do. Within a few days, we can spin
                        another GPU and add that to our resources. Also, because we’re growing very
                        quickly, collaboration is really important between team members. It’s a lot
                        easier to do that if you have a centralized system and resources that we can
                        coordinate.

                      <p>
                        I want to add another point about security. We don’t have to manage our own
                        systems and security for data which is key, and that’s something that ISAIC
                        is handling and we don’t have to think about.

                      <p>
                        <strong>Concordia:</strong> Concordia has been seeing rapid student growth
                        in all areas over the past few years and that’s been really exciting, but
                        also really, really challenging. From an IT perspective, it’s put a lot of
                        stress on a lot of our systems and the ways we interact with students. To be
                        working with a partner that understands provisioning these kinds of systems,
                        means that this critical aspect of the student experience is not something I
                        need to be worried about or dealing with on a reactive basis. Having someone
                        to contact, to deal with, who understands the problem space, has been
                        really, really helpful. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <strong>Cybera:</strong> As new projects come to us, we imagine these
                        projects will change and grow with complexity and require more computing
                        infrastructure requirements as well. To meet those needs, we can’t always do
                        that ourselves in our own cloud computing environment, so we reach out to
                        the experts and ISAIC to really help us out. ISAIC’s infrastructure is
                        definitely state of the art so we’re happy to engage with you to effectively
                        run our projects and produce solutions for our clients.

                      <p>
                        <strong>Pulse Medica:</strong> I suspect our company is going to divide more
                        in two, one is on the R&amp;D side. We’re going to be adding more machine
                        learning research and development team members and we’re going to need a lot
                        more resources, not just in the number of GPUs, but also the type of GPUs. I
                        know ISAIC recently added some more high end GPU models that we’re really
                        excited to try out and we’d love to expand into that space and those
                        resources. Also, expand on how we store patient data and the amount of
                        patient data, those resources which we’d like to utilize ISAIC for as well.

                          >ISAIC: Thank you. Do you have any last words of advice regarding cloud
                          adoption?</em
                        >
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <strong>Concordia:</strong> To some degree, adopting cloud solutions is
                        inevitable. Everyone needs to scale and people’s needs, all across the
                        board, are shifting so rapidly that I don’t think in-house solutions are
                        going to cut it. When it comes to a lot of those dynamic experiences or the
                        needs of fluctuating populations, like the student body, or even your
                        research cohort when it comes to faculty, there’s a lot of variables in
                        play. Having someone you can call on to scale rapidly is really, really
                        invaluable. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <strong>Cybera:</strong> As I was saying before, there’s so many options now
                        in terms of getting started that you shouldn’t be intimated to take that
                        first step. I definitely encourage anyone to just jump in headfirst and get
                        started because there really is very little reason for you not to start to
                        explore and experiment. <br />
                         
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <strong>Pulse Medica:</strong> My main advice would be to learn to use tools
                        like <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and
                        <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, but also tools like
                        <a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a>, Data Version Control, so you can manage
                        your datasets and reproduce projects really quickly for multiple people.
                        That’s really important for cloud; to track what’s going and track progress
                        in their different projects.
